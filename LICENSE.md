# External code used

Additionally, some files and functionality draw from existing open-source code, as described below.

(1) Two files (gpuarray.h and indexer.h) are largely based on parts of the HOOMD-blue project, released

(2) The file HilbertSort.h calls, but does not modify, code released under the GNU LGPL licence by John
Burkardt. The "HilberSort.h" wrapper is used by the program to call the functions defined in the
library, and the source code from which the library can be built is in the "hilbert_sort.hpp" and
"hilbert_sort.cpp" files. Thus, this repository contains everything a user would need to relink the
application with a different version of Burkardts LGPL source code. As such CellGPU can be distributed
under a non-(L)GPL license. Credit for this library, of course, goes to John Burkardt:

(3) eigenMatrixInterface.h and .cpp interfaces with the Eigen library. Eigen is Free Software,
available from eigen.tuxfamily.org/. It is licensed under the MPL2. See https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/MPL/2.0/ for more details.

(4) Finally, the cellGPU logo was made by using the ``Lincoln Experiments'' project,
https://snorpey.github.io/triangulation/ released by Georg Fischer under the MIT license
(Copyright 2013 Georg Fischer). The image used was taken by Torsten Wittmann and is public domain,
